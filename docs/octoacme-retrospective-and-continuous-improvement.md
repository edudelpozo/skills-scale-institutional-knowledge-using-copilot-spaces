# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

### Action Item Tracking Template
Use this template to track retrospective action items for accountability and follow-through.

| Action ID | Title | Description | Owner | Due Date | Status | Success Criteria | Completion Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| RET-001 | [Action title] | [Brief description] | [Name] | [Date] | Open/In Progress/Done | [How to measure success] | [Results or learnings] |

### Action Item Categories
- **Process Improvement:** Changes to workflows, ceremonies, or documentation
- **Technical Debt:** Code quality, architecture, or infrastructure improvements
- **Team Development:** Training, knowledge sharing, or skill building
- **Tooling:** New tools, automation, or efficiency improvements
- **Communication:** Better alignment, visibility, or stakeholder management

### Example Action Items

| Action ID | Title | Description | Owner | Due Date | Status | Success Criteria | Completion Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|------------------|------------------|
