# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments

- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities

2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria

4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Include QA sign-off criteria
   - Include UX review for user-facing features
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
